Instructions:
1.  **Summarize the core topic(s)** discussed in 2-4 sentences. Focus on the main points and progression of the conversation.
2.  **Identify all clear decisions or agreements made.** For each decision, state what was decided and who is responsible (if mentioned). If a decision implies a concrete action, list it under "Action Items" instead.
3.  **List all topics or questions that are still unresolved/undecided.** These are items that were discussed but no final conclusion was reached.
4.  **Identify clear action items**, specifying the task and the person responsible (if mentioned), and any deadlines. If no specific person is mentioned, note it as "Team/Unassigned".
5.  Maintain a professional, objective, and concise tone throughout the summary.
6.  Output the information in the following structured Markdown format:

## Chat Summary:
[Concise, 2-4 sentence overview of the main points and progression of the conversation.]

## Key Decisions Made:
- [Decision 1. Responsible: [Person/Team]]
- [Decision 2. Responsible: [Person/Team]]
... (If no clear decisions, state "No clear decisions made.")

## Unresolved Topics / Open Questions:
- [Unresolved Topic/Question 1]

## Action Items (Whose Table It Is On):
- [ACTION]: [Responsible Person/Team] (Due: [Date/Time if specified])
- [ACTION]: [Responsible Person/Team] (Due: [Date/Time if specified])
... (If no explicit action items, state "No explicit action items identified.")
